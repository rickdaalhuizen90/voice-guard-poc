# User Story Implementation

**Capacity:**  
_As an expert Scrum practitioner with experience in writing user stories that adhere to INVEST criteria (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)_  

**Role:**  
_You are assisting a Product Owner in an Agile team._  

**Insight:**  
_The team is preparing for sprint planning and needs well-defined user stories to ensure alignment, clarity, and prioritization._  

**Scenario:**  
_The Product Owner has identified a feature related to Voice Authentication but requires a user story that is clear, concise, and actionable._  

**Purpose:**  
_To create a user story that meets INVEST criteria, provides clear acceptance criteria, and aligns with the team’s sprint goals._  

**Experiment:**  
_Generate a user story using the following structure:_  
- **Title:** Implement Voice Biometrics for Fraud Prevention in Checkout Process
- **As a** Shopify Merchant,
- **I want** to integrate voice biometric authentication into my store’s checkout process,
- **So that** I can reduce fraudulent transactions and provide a secure and seamless shopping experience for my customers.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - Customers can enroll their voice securely during account creation or checkout setup.  
  - The voice authentication system verifies users with at least 95% accuracy before completing the checkout.  
  - A fallback mechanism (e.g., OTP or email verification) is triggered if voice authentication fails.  
  - The system complies with GDPR and other data privacy regulations, ensuring encrypted storage of voice data.  
  - The integration does not disrupt the overall checkout flow and maintains compatibility with Shopify’s existing payment gateways.  
  - The backend dashboard includes a grid displaying historical data of voice verifications, showing the status of each authentication request and storing recordings only for failed authentications.  
  - The backend dashboard tracks the number of authentication requests made per month and displays usage limits based on subscription tiers.  
  - The system offers three subscription tiers with the following details:  
    - **Tier 1 (Basic):** 1,000 requests/month at $29.99/month  
    - **Tier 2 (Professional):** 5,000 requests/month at $119.99/month  
    - **Tier 3 (Enterprise):** 20,000 requests/month at $399.99/month  
  - **Cost Breakdown Using Telnyx API Pricing:**  
    - Each request involves: 
      - **Call Cost:** $0.002 per minute (assuming a 15-second call = $0.0005/request).  
      - **Speech-to-Text Cost:** $0.025 per minute (assuming a 15-second transcription = $0.00625/request).  
      - **Total Cost per Request:** $0.00675/request.
    - For Tier 1 (1,000 requests): Total cost = $6.75 → Profit margin = $$(29.99 - 6.75) / 29.99 \times 100 = \mathbf{77\%}$$.
    - For Tier 2 (5,000 requests): Total cost = $33.75 → Profit margin = $$(119.99 - 33.75) / 119.99 \times 100 = \mathbf{71\%}$$.  
    - For Tier 3 (20,000 requests): Total cost = $135 → Profit margin = $$(399.99 - 135) / 399.99 \times 100 = \mathbf{66\%}$$.  

    Adjustments may be required to ensure profitability across all tiers while maintaining competitive pricing.

  - Merchants are notified when they approach their request limit (e.g., at 80% usage) and are prompted to upgrade their subscription tier if necessary to avoid service interruptions.  
  - The system ensures that merchants cannot exceed their tier limit without upgrading or agreeing to pay overage fees, which are set at a profitable rate for the app developer.
