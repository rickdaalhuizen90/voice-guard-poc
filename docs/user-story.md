## Title
Implement Voice Biometrics for Fraud Prevention in Checkout Process

### User Story
As a Shopify Merchant,
I want to integrate voice biometric authentication into my store's checkout process,
So that I can reduce fraudulent transactions and provide a secure shopping experience for my customers.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Customer voice enrollment is available during account creation or first checkout
2. Voice authentication system achieves 95%+ accuracy rate during checkout verification
3. Fallback authentication method (OTP/email) triggers automatically after failed voice verification
4. Voice data is encrypted and stored in compliance with GDPR requirements
5. Integration maintains compatibility with all Shopify payment gateways
6. Authentication process adds no more than 10 seconds to the overall checkout flow

### Technical Notes
* Voice data will be processed through Telnyx API
* Implementation requires secure API integration between Shopify and voice biometric service
* Voice patterns should be stored as encrypted mathematical models, not as actual recordings

### Out of Scope for This Sprint
* Detailed analytics dashboard for authentication attempts
* Subscription tier implementation
* Notification system for usage limits
