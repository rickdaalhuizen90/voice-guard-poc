## Requirement Analysis

The user story describes a voice biometric authentication system for Shopify merchants to prevent fraud during checkout. Key implicit requirements include:

1. Real-time voice authentication (95% accuracy)
2. Secure enrollment and storage of voice data (GDPR compliant)
3. Fallback authentication methods
4. Integration with existing Shopify checkout flow
5. Performance considerations (minimal user experience impact)
6. Scalability to handle various merchant tiers

## Tech Stack Selection

For this POC:
- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript for type safety
- **State Management**: React Context API (simpler than Redux for a POC)
- **API Integration**: Telnyx Voice API for biometric processing
- **Authentication**: JWT for secure sessions
- **Storage**: Simulated secure storage with encryption
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library

## Architecture Overview

1. **Voice Enrollment Component**: Handles initial voice signature recording
2. **Voice Authentication Component**: Verifies user against stored signature
3. **Fallback Authentication Component**: Provides alternative verification
4. **API Service Layer**: Abstracts Telnyx API interactions
5. **Security Layer**: Handles encryption and secure storage


## Steps

1. src/contexts/VoiceAuthContext.tsx
```typescript
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { encryptData, decryptData } from '../utils/encryption';

interface VoiceAuthContextType {
  isEnrolled: boolean;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  enrollmentInProgress: boolean;
  authenticationInProgress: boolean;
  enrollmentError: string | null;
  authenticationError: string | null;
  enrollUser: (voiceData: Blob) => Promise<boolean>;
  authenticateUser: (voiceData: Blob) => Promise<boolean>;
  resetAuthentication: () => void;
  useFallbackAuth: () => void;
  fallbackInProgress: boolean;
  fallbackCompleted: boolean;
}
...
```

Now let's implement the UI components for voice recording, enrollment, and authentication:

1. src/components/VoiceRecorder.tsx
2. src/components/VoiceEnrollment.tsx
3. src/components/VoiceAuthentication.tsx

Now, let's implement the main app component and utility functions:

1. src/utils/encryption.ts
2. src/App.ts

Let's also add tests for our components to verify they work as expected:

1. src/tests/VoiceAuth.test.tsx
